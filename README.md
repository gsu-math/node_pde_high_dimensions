This is a code example for the HJB example used in the paper "Approximation of Solution Operators for High-dimensional PDEs". 

It contains the process by which one can use to recreate the example in the paper found at
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999124009574?via%3Dihub

Requirements:
- torch >= 2.3.1
- torchdiffeq >= 0.2.4
- matplotlib >= 3.9.3

Running the default provided example_hjb.py script followed by validate_hjb_points.py should generate a sufficent result.
